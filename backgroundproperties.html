        In today's digital age, electronic waste (e-waste) is one of the fastest-growing forms of solid waste
 globally. Improper disposal of unused or broken electronic devices not only pollutes the environment
 but also poses serious health risks due to hazardous materials like lead, mercury, and cadmium.
 Despite growing awareness, there is a lack of accessible and organized platforms to manage
 e-waste effectively, especially at the community level.
 WasteWise is a web-based platform designed to address this gap by connecting individuals who
 want to responsibly dispose of their electronic waste with authorized recyclers, NGOs, and collection
 centers. The portal allows users to register, list old or unused electronic items, schedule pickups or
 drop-offs, and track their contribution to the environment. Organizations and recyclers can register to
 receive collection requests, manage pickup schedules, and spread awareness about e-waste
 hazards and safe recycling practices 
  The platform also includes an Awareness Hub, which provides educational content, interactive
 quizzes, and tips to encourage eco-friendly behavior. Users are incentivized through a reward points
 system, which can be redeemed for recognition or certifications, thereby encouraging consistent and
 responsible action.
 By bridging the gap between waste generators and recyclers, WasteWise promotes a cleaner,
 greener, and more sustainable future. The project not only helps reduce environmental impact but
 also instills a sense of digital responsibility in users - making it a socially impactful and technically
 robust solution
